## Requirements

If you want to build Bypass yourself you have to meet the following Requirements:

- Boost must be [installed on your system](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_53_0/more/getting_started/index.html)

But the iOS Part of the Library isn't up to date any more and there is a pre-built version available for Android. So there should be no need for it.

## iOS

The iOS Module of this Library isn't up to date any more. Either use the original [Bypass](https://github.com/Uncodin/bypass) or check out the corresponding [Issue](https://github.com/budsmile/bypass/issues/1) if you want to update the iOS Module.
